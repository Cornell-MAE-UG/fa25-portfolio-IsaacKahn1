## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Isaac Kahn, and I am pursuing a BS in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell Univeristy. I have a passion of complex, hands-on aerospace engineering, which I pursue through my position on the Cornell Rocketry Team (CRT). I am currently the parachute recovery system owner on CRT. This year, I have led a redesign of the entire recovery system, focusing on increased reliability and resiliency to transit hazards.
